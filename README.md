# Overview / Program Description:
We have created a drone simulator, a program tasked with managing the daily operations of an autonomous delivery drone. Each day the drone completes three deliveries, at location A, B and C. Priot to each delivery, the drone assess the essential conditions such as the current weather (sunny, windy, rainy), battery level and it checks for the presence of potential  obstacles in the path (birds, aircrafts, restricted zones, etc). Based on these conditions, the drone is programmed to take a decision of whether to proceed with the delivery, delay the delivery or return to the base for charging. At the end of each simulated day, the drone generates a mission summary displaying the total number of deliveries deliveries, successful drops, failed attempts, delayed missions, and remaining battery life.
This program simulates real-world decision-making in autonomous systems, integrating environmental awareness, logic, and adaptability. The drone evaluates factors like weather, battery, and obstacles to decide whether to proceed, delay, or return—mirroring real delivery challenges where safety and efficiency matter. Its relevance is clear, as autonomous drones are widely used in logistics, disaster response, agriculture, and surveillance. By modeling these dynamics, the simulator helps developers design modular systems that react intelligently to changing, real-time conditions.
